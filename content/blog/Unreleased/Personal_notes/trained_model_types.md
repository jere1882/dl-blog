| **TensorFlow SavedModel**               | `.pb`, `.savedmodel`                      | - TensorFlow’s default format for saving and restoring models.   - Can save both the model’s architecture and weights.   - Directory structure that includes the model’s computation graph (`.pb`) and other metadata.   - Well-suited for deployment with TensorFlow Serving.                                                   |
| **Keras H5**                            | `.h5`                                     | - A file format used by Keras (now part of TensorFlow).   - Stores the full model, including architecture, optimizer, and weights.   - Efficient for smaller to medium-sized models.   - Easy to load and save with the `load_model()` and `save()` methods.                                                                     |
| **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)** | `.onnx`                                   | - A cross-platform format designed for interoperability between different deep learning frameworks.   - Allows models to be trained in one framework (e.g., PyTorch) and deployed in another (e.g., TensorFlow).   - Supported by many frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn.                              |
| **TorchScript (PyTorch)**               | `.pt`, `.pth`                             | - PyTorch's format for saving models after they’ve been converted into a more optimized form for deployment.   - `.pt` is used for saving a model, and `.pth` often refers to storing model weights.   - Supports both scripted (traced) and eager execution models.   - Useful for exporting models to production environments. |
| **Caffe Model**                         | `.caffemodel`                             | - Caffe’s format for storing trained models.   - A binary file that contains weights and other model parameters.   - The corresponding model architecture is often stored separately in a `.prototxt` file.                                                                                                                      |
| **Scikit-learn (Joblib/Pickle)**        | `.pkl`, `.joblib`                         | - `Joblib` is commonly used to save Scikit-learn models, though `Pickle` is also an option.   - Stores trained models, including parameters and weights, as serialized Python objects.   - `Joblib` is more efficient than `Pickle` for models that include large numpy arrays.                                                  |
| **MLflow**                              | `.pkl`, `.h5`, `.onnx`, `.pth`, `.joblib` | - MLflow is a platform for managing the entire machine learning lifecycle.   - It can save models in various formats depending on the framework used, such as `.pkl`, `.onnx`, `.h5`, or `.joblib`.   - Supports versioning and tracking of experiments.                                                                         |
| **Core ML**                             | `.mlmodel`                                | - Apple’s framework for converting machine learning models to be used in iOS applications.   - Converts models from various formats (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras) into the Core ML format for use in iOS apps.                                                                                                              |
| **TFLite (TensorFlow Lite)**            | `.tflite`                                 | - TensorFlow Lite is designed for deploying models on mobile and embedded devices.   - `.tflite` files store quantized, optimized models for inference on mobile devices.   - Reduces the model’s size and improves inference speed.                                                                                             |
| **Hugging Face Model**                  | `.bin`, `.json`                           | - Used for storing pretrained models in the Hugging Face Transformers library.   - The `.bin` file contains the model weights, and the `.json` file typically contains configuration details.   - Supports large NLP models and easy fine-tuning with the `transformers` library.                                                |
| **DLA (Deep Learning Accelerator)**     | `.dlpack`                                 | - A format for transferring deep learning models across different frameworks.   - Designed for use in environments with hardware accelerators like GPUs or TPUs.   - Supported by PyTorch, TensorFlow, and other frameworks.                                                                                                     |
