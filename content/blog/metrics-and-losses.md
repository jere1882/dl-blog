# Binary classification

The following metrics are commonly used to assess the performance of classification models:

| **Metric**         | **Formula**                                   | **Interpretation**                          |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Accuracy**        | $\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$        | Overall performance of the model            |
| **Precision**       | \frac{TP}{TP + FP}                      | How accurate the positive predictions are   |
| **Recall (Sensitivity)** | \frac{TP}{TP + FN}                   | Coverage of actual positive samples         |
| **Specificity**     | \frac{TN}{TN + FP}                       | Coverage of actual negative samples         |
| **F1 Score**        | $\frac{`2TP`}{`2TP` + FP + FN}$                | Hybrid metric useful for unbalanced classes |

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve plots TPR versus FPR by varying the threshold. These metrics are summarized below:

| **Metric**                    | **Formula**            | **Equivalent**           |     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | --- |
| **True Positive Rate (TPR)**  | \$\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\$ | Recall, Sensitivity      |     |
| **False Positive Rate (FPR)** | $\frac{FP}{TN + FP}$   | $1 - Specificity} |     |

| **Metric**                     | **Formula/Definition**                                                    | **Interpretation**                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)** | Integral of the ROC curve                                              | Overall ability to rank positive samples higher than negatives across thresholds |
| **Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR)** | Integral of the Precision-Recall curve                                | Focuses on the performance of the positive class                                 |

- **AUC-ROC** scores range from 0.5 (random guessing) to 1 (perfect discrimination).
- **AUC-PR** is particularly valuable when there’s a significant imbalance between classes, as it emphasizes the minority class.

Both metrics are widely used in fields like fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and any domain with highly skewed class distributions.

# A deep dive into Cross Entropy

## Cross entropy for model evaluation

Cross-entropy measures the difference between two probability distributions, usually:
* the true distribution: what should happen
* the model's predicted distribution: what the model thinks will happen
Cross-entropy answers:
*How surprised is the model by the actual outcome?*

### Cross entropy for a single sample:

For classification, let's say there are K possible classes. Then the cross entropy is:

![[Pasted image 20250616215344.png]]
For a single model prediction q and ground truth probability p. 

E.g. 
task: predicting the class of an input(cat - dog - fish) 
for a given input, `p=[1,0,0]` (true class is cat) and `q=[0.8,0.1,0.1]` (model prediction)

Then 

H(p,q) = - log 0.8

Observations:
* The log in machine learning is always `ln` base e because the gradient is simple: `1/x`
![[Pasted image 20250616220050.png]]
* the log is applied to the model prediction:
	* p * q ->linear, the penalty is directly proportional to how good the prediction is
	* -p * log(q) -> non linear. it explodes when the model is wrong! applies thus a stronger penalty - this is because   x << -log(x) when x is small
	* Example: 
		* K=3 ; `p=[0,1,0]` ; `q1=[0.9,0.05,0.05]`; `q2=[0.4,0.3,0.3]`

| **Case**               | **Prediction qq**    | **Dot Product (p · q)** | **Cross-Entropy Loss** −log⁡q(c)-\log q(c) | **Better?**                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Confidently Wrong**  | `[0.90, 0.05, 0.05]` | **0.05**                | **2.9957**                                 | ❌ Bad — Confident but wrong → Strong penalty in CE |
| **Uncertain / Unsure** | `[0.40, 0.30, 0.30]` | **0.30**                | **1.2040**                                 | ✅ Less bad — unsure, gentler penalty               |
		* Remember that the loss should be LARGE for incorrect predictions. The dot product is actually terrible, it penalizes less the confidently wrong one!
	* Cross entropy is 0 for a perfect prediction and it's always >= 0 
	* Simple MSE is not good for classes or probabilities because it punishes large numeric errors but not uncertainty. In the above example, MSE for the confidently wrong is 0.2 and MSE for the uncertian is much larger.
	* Cross entropy is used as a loss because it's differentiable, smooth and provides very useful gradient signals. Then at evaluation time, confusion-matrix derived metrics are discrete, interpretable performance metrics more understandable for humans.

### Cross entropy for an entire dataset
Is simply averaging the cross entropy for each sample in the dataset.
## Empirical cross-entropy (Data entropy)

Given a probability distribution, entropy is a measure of uncertainty or surprise in a probability distribution:
![[Pasted image 20250616230214.png]]
* if the distribution `p` is uniform (`p(x_i) = 1/N`) the entropy is maximized. Every outcome is equally likely, maximum uncertainty.
* if the distribution is peaked (one outcome has all probability), entropy is zero - There is no uncertainty.
* Entropy is a property of the distribution itself.

In the context of ML, we can talk of the entropy of a dataset if we define the distribution of it's labels, values or features.

E.g:  
* 50% samples of class A ; 50% samples class =B => H=1
* Entropy of the labels => how varied the class labels are
* Entropy of features => how predictable or random the feature values are
* Joint entropy => how unpredictable are the pairs feature/labels

In this context, cross entropy is **not "error" or "loss"** — it’s a statistical property describing **uncertainty/diversity in the data itself**.
