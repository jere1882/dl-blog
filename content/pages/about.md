I share personal projects in applied machine learning, as well as blog posts on various topics that I find interesting to develop within the field.

In 2021, I graduated from college with a degree in Computer Science. My thesis focused on applying machine learning to astronomical datasets.

For the last 6+ years, I have been working in robotics as a Senior Software Engineer, and I have immersed myself in projects and tasks related to machine learning as much as possible.
