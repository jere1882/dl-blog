# Machine Learning Engineering

A Machine Learning Engineer bridges the gap between research and production. It’s not just about building models—it's about building *systems* that train, evaluate, deploy, and scale them.

This role blends software engineering, data science, and MLOps. Writing performant code, managing pipelines, understanding metrics, and debugging data are all part of the day-to-day.

> The ML engineer's superpower is turning promising models into real-world impact—reliably, repeatedly, and at scale.
