# Large Language Models

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, PaLM, and LLaMA have redefined what's possible with natural language. Trained on vast amounts of text, they predict and generate coherent language by modeling token probabilities.

While often viewed as black boxes, LLMs exhibit emergent behaviors—reasoning, summarization, even code generation—raising both awe and concern. Fine-tuning, prompting, and alignment are active research areas trying to steer these models toward useful and safe outputs.

> LLMs aren’t just text generators—they’re becoming general reasoning engines, but their limitations remind us they're still pattern predictors, not thinkers.
