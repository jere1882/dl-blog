# Computer Vision

Computer Vision is the field of enabling machines to "see" and interpret the visual world. From classifying objects in photos to real-time tracking and scene understanding, it's central to applications in self-driving cars, facial recognition, AR, and industrial automation.

Thanks to deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the past decade has seen a transformation in accuracy and capability. Yet, vision is more than image classification—challenges like generalization, robustness to noise, and depth understanding remain at the frontier.

> The future of computer vision lies in combining perception with reasoning—bridging pixels to high-level semantics.
