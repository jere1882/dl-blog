# Foundation Models

Foundation models are large-scale, pretrained neural networks designed to serve as a base for many downstream tasks. Trained on unlabeled web-scale data, they underpin applications in NLP, vision, and even multi-modal AI.

Their strength lies in *transferability*: a single model (e.g., CLIP, GPT, DINOv2) can be fine-tuned or prompted to tackle everything from translation to segmentation.

Still, foundation models raise crucial questions: How general is too general? What biases are inherited? How can we ensure efficiency, fairness, and interpretability?

> Foundation models blur the boundary between model and infrastructureâ€”their capabilities define what's possible downstream.
