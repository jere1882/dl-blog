# View Synthesis

View synthesis is the generation of novel images of a scene from new viewpoints, given a set of input views. It's a core problem in 3D reconstruction, virtual reality, and photorealistic rendering.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) revolutionized this field by using deep learning to encode a scene's volumetric properties. They learn not just surfaces, but how light interacts through space—enabling scenes to be rendered from arbitrary angles.

> View synthesis is where geometry, graphics, and machine learning collide—making the leap from pixels to light fields.
